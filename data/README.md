# Dashboard Project


## Setup Environment


```bash
conda create --name main-ds python=3.9
conda activate main-ds
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## run streamlib

```bash
before run the streamlit, we have to move to the dashboard file. Because that's where the the dashboard.py file is located.
```

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
